# Weather-App
Weather app to search the weather for the current day and the next 5 day forecast

## Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge is to create a 5-day weather app that accesses data from the third party API OpenWeatherMap. This API should be able to retrieve a 5-day weather forecast for the cities entered by the user and display all the data for each day. The previously searched cities and data is stored into the local storage of the browser, so the user has the ability to re-access the cities again. If there are more than 8 cities searched, the 9th city will be added to the list and the bottom city (first accessed city) will pop from the list.
